# Claude Code Instructions for Bird Photo Gallery

## Project Overview

This is **Bird Photo Gallery** - a personal bird photography management web app with Haikubox device integration for automatic species detection. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), and Supabase for photo storage.

**Repository:** https://github.com/ebenfc/bird-photo-gallery

## User Context

The user (Eben) is:
- New to coding and Claude Code
- Working on hobby/side-hustle projects
- Unable to manually correct code issues
- Using VS Code as the primary editor

**This means:**
- Code must work correctly the first time - test thoroughly before presenting
- Explain technical concepts in a detailed but accessible way
- Don't assume familiarity with programming terminology
- When something goes wrong, explain what happened and how it's being fixed

## Workflow Preferences

### Planning First
**Always start in planning mode** for any non-trivial task. This includes:
- New features
- Bug fixes that might affect multiple files
- Refactoring
- Any change that isn't a simple one-line fix

Present the plan, get approval on the approach, then implement.

### During Implementation
Once a plan is approved, proceed without asking for approval on individual steps. However:
- **Do ask** when there are genuine decisions to be made (approach choices, design decisions)
- **Don't ask** for permission to run bash commands, edit files, or execute the plan
- Use good judgment - if something unexpected comes up, pause and discuss

### Pull Requests
**Always create a PR** rather than pushing directly to main. This allows Eben to:
- Review changes in GitHub
- Merge when ready
- Maintain oversight of what's changing

PR descriptions should include:
- Summary of what changed (2-4 bullet points)
- Brief test plan or verification steps
- Link to any related context

### Testing
Run the full test suite (`npm test`) before creating a PR. Fix any failures before presenting the PR for review.

## Recent Updates (January 2026)

### UI Enhancements (PRs #24, #25, #26)

**Navigation & Links:**
- Added external links to allaboutbirds.org on species detail pages
- Made species count bubble on Gallery page clickable → routes to Species page
- Added "View species" button in photo modal (desktop & mobile) linking to species detail page

**Filtering & Sorting:**
- Simplified Gallery sort options to "Most Recent" and "Oldest First" (removed "Species A-Z" and "Recently Photographed")
- Added rarity filters (Common, Uncommon, Rare) to Species page

**Page Headers:**
- Updated Gallery: Changed "Photo Gallery" to "Gallery" (later renamed to "Feed" in PR #28)
- Updated Activity: Changed "Haikubox Activity" to "Activity"
- Added consistent descriptive sub-headers across all pages:
  - Feed: "Browse, upload, and organize your bird photography collection."
  - Species: "Your complete directory of bird species, from common backyard visitors to rare sightings."
  - Activity: "Bird species automatically detected by your Haikubox device on the property."

**Mobile UX:**
- Added swipe gesture support in photo modal (swipe left = next, swipe right = previous)
- Minimum swipe distance of 50px prevents accidental navigation
- Works in both normal and fullscreen modes

**Logo:**
- Updated Bird Feed logo with Dark Eyed Junco-inspired design (path-based SVG)
- Note: Logo may need further refinement to match mockups

### Haikubox Connection Workflow (January 2026)

**Resources Page Enhancement:**
- Replaced broken external link with functional in-page connection form
- Users can now configure their Haikubox device directly in the app
- Form includes:
  - Serial number input with validation (alphanumeric only)
  - "Test Connection" button to validate device before saving
  - "Save" button (only enabled after successful test)
  - Real-time success/error feedback
  - Auto-loads existing serial on page mount

**New Database:**
- Added `app_settings` table to store global application settings
- Settings stored as key-value pairs
- Created `src/lib/settings.ts` service for database-backed configuration

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/haikubox/test` - Validates Haikubox serial by testing connection to Haikubox API
- `GET /api/settings` - Retrieves current settings from database
- `POST /api/settings` - Saves Haikubox serial to database

**Backend Integration:**
- Updated `src/lib/haikubox.ts` to read serial from database first
- Falls back to `HAIKUBOX_SERIAL` environment variable for backward compatibility
- All Haikubox API calls (`fetchYearlyDetections`, `fetchDailyDetections`, `fetchRecentDetections`) now use database-stored serial
- No restart needed when changing device configuration

**Key Files:**
- `src/lib/settings.ts` - Settings service
- `src/app/api/haikubox/test/route.ts` - Connection test endpoint
- `src/app/api/settings/route.ts` - Settings management endpoint
- `src/app/resources/page.tsx` - Resources page with connection form
- `src/db/schema.ts` - Database schema with app_settings table

### Unassigned Species Feature (PR #27)

**User-Controlled Rarity Classification:**
- Species rarity (Common/Uncommon/Rare) is now defined by the user, not auto-assigned
- Haikubox detections that don't have a matching Species entry show "Unassigned" instead of defaulting to "Common"
- Visual: Unassigned badge has a dashed border style with plus icon to indicate action needed

**Activity Page Enhancements:**
- Added "Unassigned" filter option to quickly find species needing classification
- Clicking on unassigned species opens a modal to create a new species entry
- Modal pre-fills the common name and auto-looks up the scientific name
- User selects rarity (Common/Uncommon/Rare) and creates the species
- Detections are automatically linked to newly created species

**New Components:**
- `src/components/activity/UnassignedSpeciesModal.tsx` - Modal for creating species from Activity page

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/haikubox/detections/link` - Links detections to a newly created species by matching common name

**Type Changes:**
- `SpeciesActivityData.rarity` now allows `null` (indicates unassigned)
- `SpeciesActivityFilters.rarity` now includes `"unassigned"` option
- Added `DisplayRarity` type (`Rarity | "unassigned"`) for UI purposes

### Feed Page Updates (PR #28)

**Naming:**
- Renamed "Gallery" to "Feed" throughout the app (navigation menu and page title)
- Page description unchanged: "Browse, upload, and organize your bird photography collection."

**Mobile Filter UX:**
- Filters now hidden by default on mobile to prioritize viewing photos
- Added "Filter" button with collapsible panel
- Filter count badge shows number of active filters
- Filters slide down smoothly when expanded
- Desktop layout unchanged (filters always visible)

**Swipe Navigation Fix:**
- Fixed issue where swiping in fullscreen mode would exit to detail view
- Navigation now preserves current view state:
  - Fullscreen → swipe → stays in fullscreen for next photo
  - Detail view → swipe → stays in detail view for next photo
- Works for swipe gestures, arrow button clicks, and keyboard navigation

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - "Gallery" → "Feed" in nav
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Title rename, mobile filter toggle, restructured header
- `src/components/gallery/GalleryFilters.tsx` - Removed mobile-only bottom margin
- `src/components/gallery/PhotoModal.tsx` - Added `isNavigatingRef` and `wasFullscreenRef` to preserve view state

### Mobile UI Enhancements (PR #29)

**Species Page Mobile UX:**
- Added collapsible filter toggle matching Feed page pattern
- Filter button shows active filter count badge
- Rarity filters hidden by default on mobile, expand on tap
- Sub-header hidden on mobile (shows species count instead)
- Replaced "Add Species" button with circular floating action button (FAB) on mobile
- Desktop layout unchanged

**Activity Page Mobile UX:**
- Added collapsible filter toggle matching Feed page pattern
- Filter button shows active filter count badge
- Sub-header hidden on mobile (shows detection count instead)
- Removed "Last Heard" sort options (most recent/oldest)
- Sort dropdown moved into collapsible filter panel on mobile
- Desktop layout unchanged (sort stays outside filters)

**Species Detail Page Mobile UX:**
- Photos displayed in single column with larger 4:3 aspect ratio on mobile
- Favorite heart icon shown directly on photo thumbnails
- Photos default to fullscreen mode when opened on mobile
- Grid layout preserved on desktop

**Resources Page Styling:**
- Updated font colors to match other pages:
  - Headers: `text-[var(--forest-900)]`
  - Descriptions: `text-[var(--mist-600)]`
- Applied consistent styling to section headers, form labels, and link cards
- Added `pnw-texture` class to match page backgrounds

**Note:** Rarity tags and Haikubox activity count bubbles were already implemented on Species directory cards (SpeciesCard component) prior to this PR.

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/app/species/page.tsx` - Mobile filter toggle, FAB button, responsive header
- `src/app/species/[id]/page.tsx` - Single column photo layout on mobile, fullscreen default
- `src/app/activity/page.tsx` - Mobile filter toggle, responsive header
- `src/app/resources/page.tsx` - Font color consistency fixes
- `src/components/activity/SpeciesActivityFilters.tsx` - Sort in collapsible panel on mobile, removed last-heard options
- `src/components/activity/SpeciesActivityList.tsx` - Pass mobile filter state, report active filters to parent
- `src/components/gallery/PhotoModal.tsx` - Added `defaultToFullscreen` prop
- Test updates for mobile/desktop dual rendering

### Bug Fixes - Species Page Mobile UX (PR #31)

**Species Page Loading Title Flash:**
- Fixed loading skeleton showing "Species Directory" instead of "Species"
- Loading state now matches final heading to prevent visual flash

**Species Detail Page Fullscreen Navigation:**
- Fixed fullscreen exit behavior when `defaultToFullscreen` is true
- Tapping to exit fullscreen now closes modal and returns to scroll position
- Previously navigated to unwanted detail view instead
- Escape key now also closes modal when in fullscreen on Species detail page
- Swipe navigation between photos still works correctly in fullscreen

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/app/species/page.tsx` - Fixed loading skeleton title
- `src/components/gallery/PhotoModal.tsx` - Fixed fullscreen exit behavior

### Property Stats Widget Improvements (PR #33)

**Clickable Photographed Count:**
- Made "Photographed" species count clickable, linking to Species page
- Added hover effects (scale, background color, shadow) for better UX
- Provides quick navigation to full species directory

**Layout Redesign:**
- Redesigned widget layout: moved "Property Bird Activity 2026" from prominent header to subtle footer
- Reduced visual weight while retaining year context
- Footer includes small speaker icon and muted colors

**Species Count Fix:**
- Fixed species count discrepancy between Activity page (16) and Gallery/Species (25)
- Root cause: Widget was using `heardAndPhotographed` (species heard this year AND photographed) instead of `totalPhotographed` (all species with photos)
- Now shows accurate total across all pages (Feed, Species, Activity all show 25)
- Also fixed capture rate calculation to use correct numerator

**Key Files Modified:**
- `src/components/stats/PropertyStatsWidget.tsx` - Clickable count, footer redesign, count fix

## Clerk Authentication Integration (PR #34 - January 2026)

**Status**: PR #34 created, CI passing, awaiting merge
**Branch**: `feature/clerk-authentication`
**PR**: https://github.com/ebenfc/bird-photo-gallery/pull/34

### Current Issue (BLOCKING)

**Problem**: Railway deployment shows sign-in page but Clerk component doesn't render.
- URL shows: `bird-photo-gallery-production.up.railway.app/sign-in?redirect_url=...`
- Page shows "Welcome to Bird Feed" text but NO sign-in form
- Root cause: Railway is missing Clerk environment variables

**Solution**: Add these environment variables in Railway dashboard:
1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - from Clerk Dashboard → API Keys (starts with `pk_`)
2. `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - from Clerk Dashboard → API Keys (starts with `sk_`)

After adding, redeploy the app.

### What's Complete

**Local Development**: ✅ Working
- Sign-up/sign-in works at localhost:3000
- User created in database via manual Clerk API call
- Migration script ran successfully - existing data assigned to user
- All photos and species visible after sign-in

**CI Pipeline**: ✅ Passing
- GitHub repository secrets added: `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- CI workflow updated to use `${{ secrets.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY }}`
- TypeScript errors fixed (unused params prefixed with `_`)
- Exposed secrets removed from documentation files

**Code Changes**:
- Clerk packages installed: `@clerk/nextjs`, `svix`
- Database schema: `users` table added, `userId` fields on all tables
- Middleware: protects all routes except sign-in/sign-up/webhooks
- Auth helpers: `requireAuth()`, `getCurrentUserId()`, `isErrorResponse()`
- Sign-in/sign-up pages created with Clerk components
- Header: UserButton added (desktop + mobile)
- PhotoModal: Fixed button nesting hydration error (changed `<button>` to `<div>`)

**Key Bug Fixes This Session**:
- `auth().protect is not a function` → Changed to `await auth.protect()`
- `useSession can only be used within ClerkProvider` → Added ClerkProvider to layout
- Invalid publishable key format → User corrected typo in .env.local
- API routes returning 401 → Fixed user.ts to use `users.id` not `users.clerkId`
- Button nesting hydration error → Changed outer button to div with cursor-pointer

### Remaining Work After Railway Deployment

**Clerk Dashboard Setup**:
1. Set up webhook endpoint: `https://birdfeed.io/api/webhook/clerk`
2. Subscribe to events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
3. Copy webhook secret to Railway as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

**birdfeed.io Domain**:
- Currently birdfeed.io shows a parked domain page (not your app)
- Need to verify DNS/domain configuration points to Railway
- May need to use `bird-photo-gallery-production.up.railway.app` instead

### Key Files

**Authentication**:
- `src/middleware.ts` - Route protection
- `src/lib/authHelpers.ts` - `requireAuth()` helper for API routes
- `src/lib/user.ts` - User database operations
- `src/app/api/webhook/clerk/route.ts` - Webhook handler

**Sign-in/Sign-up**:
- `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`

**Configuration**:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Uses GitHub secrets for Clerk keys
- `.env.local` - Local Clerk keys (not committed)

### Environment Variables Needed

**Railway** (production):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk publishable key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk secret key
- `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - From Clerk webhook setup (after webhook created)

**GitHub Secrets** (for CI):
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - ✅ Added
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - ✅ Added
